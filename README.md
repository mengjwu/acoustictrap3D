**This repository includes PCB layout of phased-array, FPGA code (Verilog HDL) for actuating elements, k-Wave projects for dataset collection, Python scripts for model training, and Arduino code for gas monitoring and XY-table actuation**

**1. FPGA Code**

We use two FPGA (Cyclone III) to control 196 elements. "MRI_mjwu" is for the mian FPGA and "mjwu_ultrasound_array_secondary" is for the secondary FPGA.

**2. PCB desgin**

The "PCB artwork" is the Geber layout of PCB, and it can directly be used to manufacture PCB board.
